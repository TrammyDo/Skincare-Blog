            <p class="post-text">This is a jelly/gel cleanser that has mini bead-like substances in the product.
                While it did a great job cleansing my dry skin, I did not enjoy the chemical orange/citrus smell
                it had to it. The beads were interesting as I could feel like scrubbing my face, but they weren't
                rough on my skin. It had a nice lather, not too much, not too little. Overall, it was an average
                cleanser, nothing stood out to me. Afforable price and a good basic cleanser if you can get over the
                smell.
